=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RMed/breezedb_python.png)](https://travis-ci.org/RMed/breezedb_python)

A simple file-based database system.

**This repository contains the *Python* implementation of BreezeDB. For the pseudocode and more information on the project, please [visit the central repository](http://github.com/RMed/breeze_db/).**

This code is written for **Python 2.7**

## Main characteristics

- Breeze aims to be a simple way of storing data in files, avoiding the need for a database server to be installed and running in the machine.
- It is meant to store small amounts of data.
- All operations are done on the local file system.
- There is no need to redistribute a database with your application, as it can be created on the go.
- *XML* structure for organizing the data.
